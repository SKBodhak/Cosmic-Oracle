  "content": "Welcome to the Cosmic Oracle.<br><br>This digital sanctuary was crafted by Shyam Bodhak as a bridge between the ancient arts of astrology and modern technology.<br><br>The Oracle does not merely calculate dates; it interprets the cosmic energy present at the moment of your birth. Through the alignment of the stars, the phases of the moon, and the numerology of your life path, we seek to uncover the hidden potential within you.<br><br><b>How it Works:</b><br>All calculations—from your Life Path Number to your Tarot spread—are performed locally on your device. The Oracle acts as a mirror, reflecting the data you provide back to you in the form of cosmic wisdom.<br><br><b>The Creator:</b><br>I am a developer and dreamer fascinated by the intersection of code and consciousness. This project is a labor of love, designed to bring a moment of reflection and wonder to your day.<br><br>If you find value in these predictions, consider supporting the project or connecting with me on social media.<br><br>May the stars guide your path. ✨"
